                    I like to ride my bike ever since I was a child. 
                    I would wait till the afternoon to ride my bike in the neighborhood. 
                    The cool breeze and the peaceful neighborhood made it even more enjoyable. 
                    Sometimes, I would race with my friends just for fun. 
                    One of my hobbies is gaming, which I have enjoyed since I was young. 
                    I first started gaming on my father's PC, also when I was a child. 
                    We would take turns playing, and it was so much fun. 
                    I also played on my PSP, where I enjoyed games like Transformers and GTA. 
                    Exploring open worlds and completing missions was very exciting. 
                    My parents also introduced me to badminton, which became another favorite activity. 
                    I enjoyed playing it a lot, even though it was challenging at first. 
                    I remember being frustrated because I could not hit the shuttlecock properly. 
                    However, with practice, I got better and started enjoying it even more. 
                    One hobby that I did not know would pique my interest is solving a Rubik's cube. 
                    I first started by solving a 3x3, which felt like a huge achievement. 
                    Then, I became more curious and learned to solve a 2x2 Rubik's cube as well. 
                    Over time, I kept challenging myself with bigger cubes. 
                    Now, I can solve cubes from 2x2 to 6x6, which makes me feel accomplished. 
                    Each cube presents a new challenge that keeps me engaged. 
                    Whether it's biking, gaming, badminton, or solving puzzles, my hobbies keep me active and entertained.

                    Since I am an IT student, technology is the field that interests me the most. 
                    One of my skills is coding, which I have been developing over time. 
                    I can code in Java, Python, and C#, which are great for different types of projects. 
                    Although I can only do small projects with them, I am quite proud of it. 
                    It is very satisfying when the program works exactly the way I want it to. 
                    I also learned MySQL for database management, which is useful for handling data efficiently. 
                    I prefer backend development over frontend because I am not a creative person. 
                    Designing user interfaces is difficult for me, so I do not enjoy frontend work. 
                    Even though I dislike frontend, I have learned some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                    It is a very challenging area for me since I struggle with creating designs from scratch. 
                    However, I still try to improve because frontend skills are needed for IT. 
                    As a programmer, I need to think critically to debug my code and understand how it works. 
                    Problem-solving is a crucial skill that every programmer must have. 
                    I always try to find solutions to errors and improve my logic. 
                    Being adaptable is also important since programming languages and technologies evolve constantly. 
                    I am always open to learning new languages and frameworks. 
                    Exploring new technologies keeps me motivated and engaged in my studies. 
                    Even though coding can be frustrating, the satisfaction of solving a problem makes it worthwhile. 
                    I enjoy the process of writing, testing, and refining my code. 
                    In the future, I hope to work on more advanced projects and expand my skills further.

                    I am mainly interested in technology since that is the area I am most fond of. 
                    I have a strong passion for creating software, specifically games. 
                    Game development has interested me ever since I was a teenager because I loved playing video games. 
                    One day, I thought to myself, "What if I was the one who made these games?" That idea sparked my curiosity about how games are built. 
                    In line with this, I am also interested in learning other programming languages, especially C++. 
                    I noticed that C++ is commonly used in video game development, which made me want to learn it. 
                    Mastering C++ would help me a lot in creating games. 
                    But aside from game development, I am now interested in cybersecurity, particularly penetration testing. 
                    It fascinates me because it's like being a detective, where I have to find vulnerabilities in systems. 
                    However, cybersecurity is new to me, so I know it will take time to learn. 
                    I am willing to put in the effort because it is crucial in todayâ€™s digital world. 
                    Another field that captures my interest is robotics. 
                    My fascination with robotics started when I was a kid, as I always loved robots. 
                    It is amazing to see real-life robots perform tasks that were once only possible in science fiction. 
                    The combination of coding and hardware makes robotics an exciting field to explore. 
                    Learning how to program robots and make them function would be incredible. 
                    Both game development and robotics require problem-solving and creativity, which makes them exciting. 
                    All these fields require continuous learning, which is something I enjoy. 
                    It is crazy how all these interests interconnect with one another. 
                    In the future, I hope to improve my skills in these areas and possibly work on projects that combine them.
